# ChatGPT styled blinking cursor

![](./images/blink-cursor.gif)

## Usage

`typeWrite()` takes 4 arguments:

1. `string`: paragraph content
2. `string`: `HTML` content container
3. `string`: single text
4. `string`: cursor

Less than 70 lines of code, native JavaScript, feel free to download and play with it. What sucks is that the blinking cursor used to be a little black solid square and now is a little black solid circle.

As long as they don't change the look of the blinking cursor quite often enough, then this repo remains in its place. ðŸ™‹
